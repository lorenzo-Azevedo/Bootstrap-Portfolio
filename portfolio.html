It was like mentioned in Moby Dick a couple of times. Also I'm Brazilian but don't ask me about the World Cup beause I do not know anything about soccer other than Pel√© is from my city. 
                                    <p>Before I moved to NYC for undergrad at NYU Stern, I split my time between World of Warcraft and jumping horses - equitation eowww. I went to an arts highschool were I did some coding, but my "mediums", we were all pretentious young artists, were analog photography (duh) and mixed media.</p>
                                    <p>While in college I got degrees in finance and art, was on the eboard of my fraternity and of Stern's international committee. After graduating I worked in structuring and securitizations for 2 years. It was really boring and the hours sucked X_x Currently I am working for an accounting software firm which is cool and a great conversation starter at bars. I basically help lead both products and development teams on implementations for Enterprise Level clients. I am enjoying this new job much more, however I would like to move into a career where I can apply my design $killz. In my free time I like to go to museums, travel to iconic exotic locations for content and sip on vodka sodas at the beach.</p>

    <!-- I dont really find bootstrap to be intuitive or easier... is it something that we will be expected to use a lot in the real world? Is it ok to prefer css + html without boot strap. I can see where people might like the ease of the responsiveness but aside from that I am not understanding how one can have a true control of format and desgin with this... Are there videos or an external resource you would recommend for me to better understand the purpose and how to correctly use bootstrap?-->
